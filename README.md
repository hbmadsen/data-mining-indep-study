# data-mining-indep-study

## This is the repo to keep track of tools & progress of my Spring 2020 independent study on data mining of health data.
Will not be posting anything involving the actual data that I am using for study as it is not public. I will also update my progress on this README.

### 3.15.20 Set up Jupyter Notebook & tested LOF Algo
#### installed pyenv & created env for this project
commands used to activate env: pyenv activate jupyterdev-3.8.2
I tested the LOF algo with the example from scikit: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html

### 4.14.20 LOF on Iris, Wine, and Forest Fire datasets
#### installed pandas using pip & read in csv files 
I imported iris and wine datasets from Scikit Learn
I downloaded and uploaded the forest fires dataset from UCI ML Repo
I am currently struggling to extract the data matrix from the forest fires data set
and my other data set (that I must keep private) that I need to actually run LOF
