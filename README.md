# data-mining-indep-study

## This is the repo to keep track of tools & progress of my Spring 2020 independent study on Data Mining of health data.
Will not be posting anything involving the actual data that I am using for study as it is not public. I will also update my progress on this README.

### 3.15.20 Set up Jupyter Notebook & tested LOF Algo
#### installed pyenv & created env for this project
commands used to activate env: pyenv activate jupyterdev-3.8.2
I tested the LOF algo with the example from scikit: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html
